* [A History of Haskell: Being Lazy With Class](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/history-of-haskell/history.pdf) by Paul Hudak, John Hughes, Simon Peyton Jones

* :scroll: [Making a Fast Curry: Push/Enter vs. Eval/Apply for Higher-order Languages](../haskell/making-a-fast-curry-push-enter-versus-eval-apply-for-higher-order-languages.pdf) by Simon Marlow and Simon Peyton Jones. A classic... describes well the execution model GHC uses for Haskell, and catches the brilliant authors in a design pivot from original intuition to new conclusions based on empirical data.
* :scroll: [A Poor Man's Concurrency Monad](../haskell/a-poor-mans-concurrency-monad.pdf) by Koen Claessen. Paper describes how without adding any primitives to the language, you could define a concurrency monad transformer in Haskell.
